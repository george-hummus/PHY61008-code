"""
Script to filter targets from the TNS database, calaculate how long they're visible for on the night
in question and uses this information along with their transit altitude, lunar separation, time
discovered, time modified, and magnitude to calculate a priorty score for observing them with the
Liverpool Telescope on La Palma, Espa√±a.

Depends on filter_funcs.py script to operate.
